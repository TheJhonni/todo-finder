    "p": "Much remains to be learned from exploring the mysteries of the deep. From mapping and describing the physical, biological, geological, chemical, and archaeological aspects of the ocean to understanding ocean dynamics, developing new technologies, and unlocking other secrets of the ocean, NOAA is working to increase our understanding of the ocean realm.",
    "body": "The ocean is the lifeblood of Earth, covering more than 70 percent of the planet's surface, driving weather, regulating temperature, and ultimately supporting all living organisms. Throughout history, the ocean has been a vital source of sustenance, transport, commerce, growth, and inspiration. Yet for all of our reliance on the ocean, more than eighty percent of this vast, underwater realm remains unmapped, unobserved, and unexplored.",

    "title": "Ocean vs Space",
    "subtitle": "The answer seems obvious. Space is infinite and out of reach, while the oceans are finite and limited to our planet. We have been sailing the oceans for centuries, while space exploration is less than a century old.",
    "p": "We must know more about the oceans, right? How could our oceans contain more mysteries than outer space? In truth, the answer is complicated. Although we’ve been cruising the oceans for much longer, much of the ocean remains uncharted, unexplored and unseen by human eyes. In fact, the percentage of the oceans that have been explored, just might shock you.",
    "superP": "How Much of the Ocean Have We Discovered?",
    "body": "Nautical exploration is as old as humans. There were sailors and sea merchants mentioned in the Bible, and maritime travel and commerce was common during the ancient period, as the Romans and Greeks both took to the seas to explore. And today, we remain committed to sea travel. From the global shipping industry, to luxury yacht charters, hundreds of thousands of nautical miles are covered each day around the world. Yet, despite our oceans being more trafficked than ever, they remain mostly a mystery. So how much of the ocean has been explored? According to the National Ocean Service, it’s a shockingly small percentage. Just 5 percent of Earth’s oceans have been explored and charted – especially the ocean below the surface. The rest remains mostly undiscovered and unseen by humans. That doesn’t seem like it could be true. The oceans account for 70 percent of Earth’s surface. In other words, humans haven’t yet explored or discovered about 65 percent of Earth’s surface area. And considering the explorations that have occurred in space over the last decades – detailed imaging of the Moon, Mercury and Mars – it seems space exploration is moving at a faster speed than ocean exploration.",

    "title": "How Much of the Ocean Have We Explored?",
    "subtitle": "Why do we know so little about the oceans? And why haven’t scientists explored 95 percent of them?",
    "p": "Well, there are two reasons ocean exploration is so difficult. For starters, the technology used to chart the oceans and ocean floors is relatively new. Ocean satellites, scientific buoys, deep sea submarines, and advanced sonar have only been used in ocean exploration for the last 50+ years. And as this technology improves, scientists have been able to discover more of the oceans and map a greater percentage of the ocean’s floors.",
    "superP": "In short, we’ve only explored 5 percent of the oceans, because exploring the depths is so treacherous and difficult.",
    "body": "Yet, even with technology improving, there is still a major challenge, and that’s that the ocean is so vast. Consider this: At its deepest the ocean is 7 miles deep. This abyss is located in an area near Guam known as the Mariana Trench, which is located near many popular yacht charter destinations. In other words, under the surface the oceans contain about 99 percent of livable space on the planet. And it’s this area below the surface that scientists know very little about. So why is underwater ocean exploration so difficult? For one, satellite imaging can only be used to study the surface of the ocean. We can chart water temperatures, color (an indicator of plant life), and water levels. But below the surface, our satellites don’t do much good. This inability to “see” the oceans is what makes space exploration and ocean exploration so vastly different. With space exploration, scientists can see everything that’s in front of them, using telescopes. With ocean exploration, we’re can’t see very far. Light doesn’t permeate deep into open water. After 200 meters – the so-called sunlight zone – light begins to decline significantly, making imaging much more difficult. Additionally, the conditions under the ocean make exploration a battle of extremes. At the deepest part of the ocean, pressure is significant – it’s the equivalent of having 50 airliners on top of you. And that’s significantly more pressure than the body can handle. Additionally, the depths of the ocean are extremely cold and dark, and that makes traveling there difficult for scientists. In fact, it’s easier to send a person to space than it is to send one down to the bottom of the deepest part of the ocean.",

        "Ocean exploration is the search for ocean creatures, ecosystems and other discoveries to increase our understanding of the ocean. The information gathered helps us understand how climate and weather changes on Earth are being affected. Moreover, the information can help with oceanographic navigation, cartography, shipbuilding, and much more.",
        "Nearly 80 percent of the Earth’s oceans are unexplored or unmapped as of 2021.",
        "Water column samplers and buoys are used by researchers and oceanographers to explore oceans, monitor their surface and quality of water. Other devices like remote-operated vehicles and sonars help them create ocean mapping and travel efficiently and safely deep within the oceans. Diving is another tool that is used to explore ocean waters.",
        "The Office of Ocean Exploration and Research (OER) under NOAA has the task of exploring oceans to discover useful information that can help strengthen the United States’ economy, health and security. The OER is the sole program by the U.S. federal government that is responsible for ocean exploration.",
        "Yes, NASA has been exploring oceans from space for many years. In 1978, NASA sent its first civilian oceanographic satellite into space. They called it the Seasat, which carried five crucial sensor technologies, namely: The Synthetic Aperture Radar, The Visual and Infrared Radiometer, The Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer, Scatterometer System and The Radar Altimeter."
